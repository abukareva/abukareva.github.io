        <h3>The project</h3>    
        	<p>In late 2015, I worked with Bazaar Cafe, a small San Francisco neighborhood cafe that offers original live music in the evenings.</p>

          <p>Bazaar Cafe already had an existing website, but they needed a redesign of their landing page and streamline their nightly events calendar management process.</p>
