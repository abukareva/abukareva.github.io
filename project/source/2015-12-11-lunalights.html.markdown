In 2015, a team of students at Startup Institute and I redesigned a website for a startup called Luna Lights. Luna Lights offers a preventative and predictive solution for night-time fall safety.

When they came to us for help, they wanted a complete overhaul of their website, rebranding and all. They had quickly thrown together their current website over a year prior and needed to develop a website that was attractive to future clients while maintaining a sleek, stylish design to attract future hires. It was important for them to look "cooler" while still communicating their message effictively to assisted living communities.

Our research process included reaching out to assistant living facilities to determine the flow of questions the target audience would have and need answers to during their experience on the Luna Lights website. We used those insights to create user personas, wireframes and, ultimately, high fidely mock-ups.
