I was the web designer conjointly with the role as project manager. My responsibilities as the designer, was to design a campaign dashboard for the employees to view all the campaign data as well as redesign their current website. As project manager, I was the point of contact with the product team and kept my team aligned with project objectives and managing our timeline. My team then collaborated on presenting our findings to the TextNinja team.

At the end of our month-long project, we had the opportunity to present our findings and recommendations to the project director and communications lead. They greatly appreciated our efforts and were delighted with our results.
