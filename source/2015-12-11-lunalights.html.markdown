		<h3>The Project</h3>
			<p>In 2015, a team of students at Startup Institute and I redesigned a website for a startup called Luna Lights. Luna Lights offers a preventative and predictive solution for night-time fall safety.</p>

			<p>When Luna Lights co-founders, Donovan Morrison and Matt Wilcox, came to us for help, they wanted a complete overhaul of their website, rebranding and all. They had quickly thrown together their current website over a year prior and needed to develop a website that was attractive to future clients while maintaining a sleek, stylish design to attract future hires. It was important for them to look "cooler" while still communicating their message effictively to assisted living communities.</p>

			<p>Our research process included interviewing administration at assistant living facilities to gain more insight to current monitoring processes and tools used for fall prevention, any budget limitations, and methods of educating staff on new technologies. This helped us prioritize our content by determining important questions our target audience would need answers to.</p>

			<p>We learned that they wanted to understand how the device worked and see proof that it worked at other facilities. It was a surprise to us that pricing wasn't a large concern since the facilities pass these costs onto the families. The current fall prevention methods in place were ineffective and provided a false sense of security to the family. We added a 'tell your living facility' feature in order anyone one concerned or unhappy about the current fall prevention methods at their facility to be heard and take action.</p>

			<p>We used those insights to create user personas, wireframes and, ultimately, high fidely mock-ups.</p>
